# Tutorial: Shapes and Colors

Part 1: Basic scene setup with a single shape.

Part 2: Parameters for shape switching and color selection.

Part 3: Camera distance control.

Part 4: Action buttons and callbacks for color management.

Part 5: Refactoring for cleaner, scalable code.

Part 6: Runtime information updates using parameter watching

This progression introduces beginners to Codea and Lua step-by-step, building complexity while keeping the code manageable! Let me know if you'd like adjustments or additional details.

# Study Overview

Progression: The tutorial starts with a static scene (Part 1), adds user control (Parts 2-4), and refines the code for efficiency (Part 5).

Learning Curve: Beginners learn core Codea concepts (scene, rendering) first, then interactivity (parameters, buttons), and finally programming best practices (refactoring).

Key Takeaways: Each part builds on the previous one, introducing one or two new concepts while reinforcing earlier lessons. By Part 5, users understand both functionality and code organization.

Flexibility: Notes highlight how concepts like tables and loops in Part 5 can be applied earlier, encouraging experimentation.
